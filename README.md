Persian TTS is a simple text-to-speach synthesizing engine and ReactNative app that I have initially developed as my Bachelor's degree graduation project.

The project is however meant to get gradual improvements over time.

## â˜‘ Requirements

Persian-TTS apps are powered by [React Native][r] so you will need it for compiling the apps properly.
To compile android version, having a proper [Android SDK][a] on your machine is a must and evidently compiling iOS varient needs you to have a working [Xcode][x] copy and a functional [Cocoapods][c] dependency management tool on a MacOS operating system powered machine.

You will also need to have a dependency management tool for accessing NPM and download project's dependencies. [Yarn][y] is preferrable for it's performance but [NPM][n] is also just fine.
